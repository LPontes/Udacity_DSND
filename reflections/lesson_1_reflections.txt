How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The commit message can have a hint about possible bugs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It allows to move back to a previous version when experimental changes go wrong

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The manual way gives more us control, because we can choose when to save changes and what area those changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because programming code often have connections between multiple files, and a change in one file can affect other files


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    First I will get used to it with some toy projects. Once familiarized with Git I will use it to store and share future projects
