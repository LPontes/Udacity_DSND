## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be necessary to install folium and seaborn libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from Bristol to better understand:

1. Income per month.
2. How Airbnb activity changes for each month.
3. Spatial distribution of the income. There is any difference between neighborhoods?
4. What factors about an host and home contributed to the income?

The dataset used is available on http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There are two .csv files with the used data

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/how-much-can-one-make-with-airbnb-in-bristol-uk-an/how-much-can-one-make-with-airbnb-in-bristol-uk-an-exploratory-analysis-7363f2f6452).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Airbnb link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
